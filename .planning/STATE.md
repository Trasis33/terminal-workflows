## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01-D1] Used goccy/go-yaml instead of gopkg.in/yaml.v3 (unmaintained since April 2025)
- [01-01-D2] Used adrg/xdg instead of os.UserConfigDir() (returns wrong path on macOS)
- [01-01-D3] Typed string fields eliminate Norway Problem without custom MarshalYAML
- [01-01-D4] Store interface pattern for testable CRUD operations
- [01-01-D5] Slug-based filenames for workflow YAML files
- [01-02-D1] Split on first colon only for name:default parsing (allows URL defaults)
- [01-02-D2] Return nil slice for no params (idiomatic Go)
- [01-02-D3] Last default wins for duplicate parameter names
- [01-03-D1] Interactive prompts gated on missing required fields (no prompts when all flags provided)
- [01-03-D2] Exported WorkflowPath on YAMLStore for $EDITOR integration
- [01-03-D3] Re-extract template params when command field is updated via wf edit
- [01-04-D1] Integration tests bypass global state via newTestRoot() with temp-dir YAMLStore
- [01-04-D2] Compact wf list format: name, description, [tags] — one line, greppable
- [02-01-D1] Deferred Charm stack + clipboard deps to plans that import them (Go removes unused deps on tidy)
- [02-02-D1] Mint/cyan-green color palette (Color 49, 158, 73) — avoids purple-gradient cliche
- [02-02-D2] Single commit for both tasks — Go compilation requires all package files simultaneously
- [02-02-D3] Esc quits picker entirely (not back-to-search) — consistent across both states
- [02-02-D4] Enter on non-last param advances to next — reduces friction
- [02-03-D1] Ctrl+G as default keybinding — overrides readline's rarely-used "abort" in bash, safe in zsh/fish
- [02-03-D2] Replace existing prompt text (atuin approach) — wf outputs complete commands, not fragments
- [02-04-D1] Use /dev/tty for TUI output instead of fd swap — ZLE redirects fds before subprocess starts
- [02-04-D2] Ctrl+Y for in-picker clipboard copy with flash message
- [02-04-D3] Fallback to os.Stderr if /dev/tty unavailable (Windows compatibility)
- [03-01-D1] themeStyles struct kept in styles.go for separation; Theme and computeStyles() in theme.go
- [03-01-D2] Independent preset themes (not derived from huh) — management TUI theme struct has different fields
- [03-01-D3] Dialog overlay uses lipgloss.Place with whitespace chars for visual depth

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags TIOCSTI deprecation as Phase 2 blocker — must use shell function wrappers, not ioctl ✅ (resolved: shell function wrappers implemented)
- Copilot CLI SDK is technical preview (Jan 2026) — re-assess stability before Phase 5 planning
